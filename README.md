# Operational Insights for NYC Taxi Dataset

## **Overview**

This exercise involves assessing the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of key trip and fare variables — such as trip distance, passenger counts, pickup and dropoff coordinates, and fare amounts — using exploratory techniques and automated data validation tools.

The analysis will also address data quality concerns, distinguish between genuine anomalies and explainable outliers, and provide guidance for data scientists and engineers working with this dataset to ensure robust, reproducible, and interpretable modeling outcomes.

## **Objective**

To analyze the 2013 NYC Taxi trip and fare datasets and identify opportunities for revenue optimization and cost reduction.

## Conclusion

If additional time and resources were available, the next phase of work would focus on:

- Conducting a deeper validation of data source integrity, including collection methods and licensing verification.
- Implementing a cloud-native, containerized architecture (e.g., Docker) to scale the analysis and enable integration with the team’s internal databases.
- Leveraging PyTorch DataLoader or similar tools to improve dataset iteration efficiency and memory handling.
- Given the dataset's size, I would add an extra stage to store the dataset as parquet for easy load / merging for the data teams.

Next Steps

- Establish Slack or Jira alerts to automatically stream validation results and quality exceptions to the analytics team.
- Integrate the Great Expectations pipeline into a continuous monitoring workflow, tied to version-controlled data releases.

Good to Have

- Develop a modular CLI framework powered by lightweight AI agents to dynamically generate Soda or Great Expectations rule sets.
- Extend the infrastructure with PySpark for distributed processing across larger temporal partitions of the NYC dataset.
